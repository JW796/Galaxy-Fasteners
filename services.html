                <h3>JIT / Stock Release</h3>
                <p>The best way to reduce price volatility risk on hardware is with a stock release program. You place your annual quantity orders with us, and we will release to you, when needed. This helps to minimize inventory and manage one-time spending. We will work with you to develop a release strategy, whether thatâ€™s at pre-determined dates or when you run out!</p>
